						</p>
						<ul class="text-color mb-4 list-outside list-disc px-4">
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Swap Cost: </span>
								Each trade is subject to the cost of spreads and commissions on opening and to the swap/rollover
								that is applied every night for the amount of 3% yearly, and up to 2% daily night on
								cryptocurrency, on the position value opened.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Dormant Fee: </span>
								Each account will be subject to a monthly dormant fee of 25USD IF the account doesn’t
								open any trade for at least 60 days. The dormant fee calculation will be charged on a
								monthly basis and will be not calculated from the system if the trading account has been
								used again. The fee cannot be refunded since it’s a compliance and brokerage fee for
								account maintenance.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Rollover Definition: </span>
								Is also called Swap. It is the interest paid or for holding a position overnight. Each
								world currency has an interest rate connected to it. Since forex is traded in pairs,
								every trade involves not only two different currencies but also two different interest
								rates. If the interest rate on the currency you bought is higher than the interest rate
								of the currency you sold, then you will earn a rollover (positive roll). If the interest
								rate on the currency you bought is lower than the interest rate on the currency you sold,
								then you will pay rollover (negative roll). Rollover can add a significant extra cost
								or profit to your trade depending on.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Rollover Example: </span>
								When you buy the EUR/USD pair, you are buying the euro, and selling the U.S. dollar to
								pay for it. If the euro interest rate is 1.00%, and the U.S. rate is 0.25%, you are buying
								the currency with the higher interest rate, and you will earn rollover — about 0.75%
								on an annual basis. Conversely, if you sell the EUR/USD pair, you are selling the currency
								with the higher interest rate, and you will pay rollover — about 0.75% on an annual basis
								since you are paying the euro interest rate and earning the U.S. interest rate.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Rollover Booking Times: </span>
								he beginning and end of the forex trading day are considered to be 00:00 (GMT) by our
								servers. Any positions that are open at 00:00 (GMT) sharp are considered to be held overnight
								and are subject to rollover. A position opened at 00:01 (GMT) is not subject to rollover
								until the next day, while a position opened at 23:59 (GMT) is subject to rollover at
								00:00 (GMT).
							</li>
							<li>
								A credit or debit for each position opened at 00:00 (GMT) will appear in your
								account and be applied directly to your account balance.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="font-semibold">Weekends and Holidays: </span>
								Most banks across the world are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, so there is no rollover
								on these days, but most banks still apply interest on Saturdays and Sundays. To measure
								for this, the forex market books three days of rollover on Wednesdays, which makes a
								typical Wednesday rollover three times the amount. Please note that for some instruments
								triple swap is applied on Friday. There is no rollover on holidays, but there is an extra
								day’s worth of rollover two business days before the holiday. Typically, holiday rollover
								happens if any of the currencies traded has a major holiday. Therefore, President in
								the USA, February 21st, closes American banks, and an extra day of rollover is added
								at 00:00 (GMT) on the previous working day for all U.S.D pairs.

					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						The Swap and Spread ratios applied when Investing with DB Investing are indicated on our
						website at the page <a
							href="https://dbinvesting.com/trading-conditions/"
							target="_blank"
							class="text-dbgreen-500">https://dbinvesting.com/trading-conditions/</a

					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						For investors who are new to trading, we have briefly summarized what these expressions
						mean.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						<span class="font-semibold">Swap,</span> Swap Fees are the cost of a trade that is applied
						to transactions that are open at the end of the day resulting from the difference between
						the interest rates of the countries to which the currency pair is traded. “Forex” money is
						lent money in Forex markets and “Sold” money is borrowed. According to this logic, you can
						see the swap income or cost as follows in the simplest way;
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						<span class="font-semibold">Swap position,</span> If the interest rate of the received money
						is low and the interest rate of the money being sold is high (-), the cost is deducted from
						the investor’s account. If the interest rate of the sold money is low and the interest rate
						of the money received is high (+) It is returned to the investor as income.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="my-3">
					<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Rules Regarding Swap Fees</h2>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						Swap costs or revenues are not applied to positions closed on the same day. Swap rates
						apply to positions that are still open at the end of the day.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						Change swap balances because of the interest rates of the countries to which the
						relevant currency units belong.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						A 3-day swap is applied to positions that are not yet closed on Thursdays (equivalent to
						the value of the weekend) because the Forex market is valued at +2 days. On other days
						this practice is 1 day.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						You can choose the Islamic Account option as a non-swap-based application.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="my-3">
					<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Spread</h2>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						The difference between the buying and selling prices of financial assets is called
						“Spread” and is expressed in “pip” unit.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						For example, if the buying price is 1.1225 and the selling price is 1.1223 in the EURUSD
						parity, this spread is 2 pips for Spread (1,1225-1,1223 = 0,002). Therefore, when you
						open a lot (i.e. 100 thousand units) in one lot, you will end up with a cost of 0,0002 *
						100,000 = 20 USD Spread.
					</p>
					<p class="text-color mb-3">
						It is only the cost to open this position. If the parity reaches 1,1227, your cost will
						be zero. Spread, which is an important cost for the investor, can be fixed or variable.
						Variable Spread is low at times of increased liquidity in the markets but may be high in
						liquidity shortage. Fixed Spreads are fixed values offered to investors of brokerage
						houses.
